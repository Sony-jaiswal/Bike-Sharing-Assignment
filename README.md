# Bike sharing predictor model
> A Data Set has been presented to us with information about bike bookings and various associated factors. We are expected to make an ML predictor of future demand so the company can deploy its resources accordingly.



* General Info -
After surviving the corona associated business crash, the American bike sharing company BoomBikes has hired us to predict forthcoming demand of the bikes to deploy the precious and now diminished resources where the returns can be highest.

*Required Outcome-
The company wants to know:
Variables significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
How well those variables describe the bike demands.

* Technologies Used-
-Microsoft Windows 10 pro , 
version 10.0.19045 Build 19045
-Command prompt
-IDE-jupyter notebook
Programming Languages Used
Python (3.9.13); (Bundled With conda)
C (Based Libraries Imported in the Code, Numpy, pandas, etc)
Libraries Used
Seaborn (0.11.2)
re (regex interpreter)
matplotlib (3.5.2)
numpy (1.21.5)
pandas(1.4.4)
Cloud Services Used-
Git/Github. (All other operations and development done on local machine, no cloud services used.)
